## Getting Started

To begin using TestSprite for front-end testing, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Front-End Testing Environment

1. **Log in** to your TestSprite account and go to the **Overview** section.
2. Click on **Create New Test**, which will automatically proceed to the **Front-End (UI) Testing** step.
3. Enter the **Web Application Details**:
   - Web application starting URL.
   - Any authentication credentials if needed (e.g., username, password).

    ```json
    {
      "web_app_url": "https://www.example.com",
      "username": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    ```

4. **Add More URLs** if you have multiple pages to test within the same flow.

### Step 2: Configure Test Plans

1. **Review the Test Plan**:  
   Examine the test plan, which includes a variety of test scenarios tailored to your application's needs, such as:

   - **Test the 'Log In' Link Functionality**:  
     Ensure that the 'Log In' link directs users to the correct login page, triggering authentication flows properly and guiding users to their dashboard or profile page after a successful login.

   - **Test the 'Add to Cart' Button in Product Listings**:  
     Verify that clicking the 'Add to Cart' button accurately adds the selected product to the user's shopping cart, updates the cart count, and displays confirmation messages as expected.

   - **Test the 'Close Banner' Button Functionality**:  
     Ensure that clicking the 'Close' button on pop-up banners, promotional messages, or notifications dismisses the banner correctly, without disrupting other page elements.

   - **Verify Link Redirection for Page Load Accuracy**:  
     Confirm that navigation links redirect users to the intended pages, with appropriate loading times and accurate content display, ensuring a smooth browsing experience across different sections of your website.

2. **Select Scenarios to Execute**:  
   Based on your needs, choose the test categories and scenarios you want the AI to implement and execute for your frontend UI components.

### Step 3: Run Your Tests

1. Click **Next** to start executing your selected test plan.
2. Monitor progress through the **Web Preview** feature, which displays the tested page as actions are performed.
3. TestSprite will automatically validate UI interactions and generate a detailed report upon completion.

### Step 4: Review Test Results

After your test is complete, TestSprite provides a detailed report, for example:

> **Amazon landing page testing results**:
>  - **Total Tests Run**: 20
>  - **Pass/Fail Ratio**: 16 Passed, 4 Failed
>  - **Interaction Success Rate**: 80%

## Advanced Features

### Web Preview for Context

TestSprite includes a **Web Preview** feature that allows you to visualize the testing process:

- Watch as each element is interacted with on your web page.
- Understand how the page responds to various actions.
- Quickly identify UI issues that might otherwise be missed.

### Using Natural Language for Feedback

TestSprite also allows you to **give feedback** using natural language. For example:

```plaintext
"Check if the 'Add to Cart' button works as expected on small screens."
```

TestSprite interprets the feedback and adjusts the test accordingly, making it easier for you to refine test cases without needing to dive into complex configurations.
