# Our Mission and Vision


We're a team focused on making software testing easier and faster with AI. Learn more about who we are and what drives us.

## Why We Do What We Do

We believe that autonomous, AI-powered software testing represents a transformative point for coding, and will drive significant improvements in software quality, accelerate time-to-market, and boost developer productivity.

* Our mission is to enhance software quality, developer productivity, and security for coders – by freeing them from time-consuming testing, thus empowering them to focus on innovation and development flow.

## What We Do

TestSprite delivers the capabilities of a dedicated software test engineer, automating testing for both back-end and front-end systems. It's ideal for smaller developer and DevOps teams, or developers seeking self-serve QA and code validation. TestSprite constructs and executes comprehensive test plans, managing the coding and analysis—requiring developers to only provide minimal input, such as API documentation.

Gone is the need to spend hours writing step-by-step testing instructions, as well as the risk of missing unique corner cases, compliance rules, or security issues.
